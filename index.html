            <p>Hi! I'm a junior developer currently focused on improving my web development skills, but I have experience in other programming languages as well. My currently proficient languages include HTML, CSS, Javascript, Excel VBA, and GAB.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I also have experience in the manufacturing world, with logistics and planning being my focus. I have worked in warehousing, purchasing, process improvement, and IT. I also have done various amounts of programming in each of these positions, in either VBA or GAB.</p>
